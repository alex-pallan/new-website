        <p>
          For those living in the dorms at Iowa State University, recycling is
          quite easy. Just as easy as taking out the trash. With dumpsters
          located right next to each other for recycling and landfill. Since
          moving into the on-campus apartments, however, I have found recycling
          to be much less clear.

        <p>
          My first semester living outside of a dorm, I did the same as the
          majority of residents living in my community. I took all of my waste
          to the one dumpster located in my parking lot. After all, my days are
          quite busy when I am at school, and I only have so much time to deal
          with my trash, so I take the most convenient option. By the end of
          that semester, however, I took some time to reflect on what I had
          thrown away.
        </p>
        <p>
          After taking some time to assess what I throw away, I decided that a
          change needed to be made, so I took to my computer to do some
          research.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first concern was ensuring that the items in the recycling were
          actually recycled. After all, much of what recycle

            target="_blank"
            >may not actually be recycled</a
          >. Looking into it, the results I found were... conflicting.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you put something in the recycling, it gets put in a truck and
          driven down to Des Moines and unloaded at a "Materials Recovery
          Facility"<sup><a href="./#source-1">[1]</a></sup
          >. This is all well and good, however I do not like the lack of
          information when it comes to where specifically it goes. Nevertheless,
          I can only assume that it is taken care of properly and not simply
          sent to a landfill (nearby or otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, with that preliminary step out of the way, where can I actually
          put my recyclables?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, finding that out without driving around every street in town was
          a bit more difficult. I actually had quite a bit of trouble finding
          this, only finding vague answers across the official websites. So, I
          took to Google Maps. Here is a list of all of the dumpsters I could
          find:

          I am sure there are many more, however those are the most central as
          far as residence halls go. If you're looking for the nearest one to
          you, just take to Google Maps on satellite view and look for a light
          green dumpster. Odds are that is recycling, and will be taken to Des
          Moines for processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that finding where to put it is out of the way, I wanted to come
          up with a solution to be able to store our recyclables and as well as
          keep me and my roommate motivated to put the effort in. I repurposed
          some totes I had and printed out some labels to go in them, have a
          look:

        <img src="./assets/images/IMG_2760.jpg" class="article-image" />
        <p class="article-image-caption">
          Totes with labels placed inside with basic recycling instructions
        </p>
        <p>
          When making these, I had designated one for (corrugated) cardboard
          only, and the other for all other recyclables. Later, however, I found
          this to be unnecessary as you place both into the same dumpster to be
          sorted and recycled later. It did end up being nice to have those
          sorted out anyways though, as they take up much more space. Do what
          works best for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever I would fill up these totes, my roommate and I would take our
          recycling to the nearest dumpster and voila, we now recycle! And I can
          be (<a

          Obviously the best solution to keeping our planet as intact as we can
          is not using disposable products in the first place. <i>Reduce</i> is
          first in the saying <i>Reduce Reuse Recycle</i> for a reason, after
          all. However, we live in a society where consumption of reusable
          packaging is a necessity to live daily life. So the best we can do is
          dispose of it responsibly. I hope this post inspires some to give some
          thought to what they throw in the trash, and how easy it really is to
          recycle.
